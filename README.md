# 14-reverse-engineering-code

This assignment, we were asked to look over provided code and reverse engineer what we were given.

## Explaining the code

Beginning with the server.js, we list all the dependencies to run the application and define the PORT to use. Express is needed for authentication of user. Next the routes are required for our api calls. Next sequelize is used to pass user data on to the db.
